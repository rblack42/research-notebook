# Project Setup

In this section we will cover the basic setup of a machine for Python developent. I will show you how to install the basic tools uased by ost developers today, and show how I use them to manage this proect. Experienced developers may have their own management schemes, and tthat is fine. This is by no means the only way to manage things. I have used these tools in  my teaching to indroduce new developers to the tools they need to understand.

Here are the basic tools we need to install

- [Git](./git-setup.ipynb) - for managing proect assets
- [Python](./python-installation) - the core language for this proect
- [Jupyter-Book](jupyter-installation) - for creating proect docuentation
- Sphinx - for creating seperate documentation showing program code
